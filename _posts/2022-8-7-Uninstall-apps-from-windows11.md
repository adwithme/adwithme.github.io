After downloading any app in Windows 11, there are various reasons to uninstall it. Whether to increase storage or not to use the app, we need to uninstall such apps.

Windows 11 has many options for removing apps that you find unnecessary. Today we are going to talk about some of these easy options. However, consider that not all of the methods described here may work for all apps.

These methods may not be suitable for uninstalling some built-in apps (apps on any device's system). For that you need to use the command prompt.
