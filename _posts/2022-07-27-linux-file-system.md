## What Is Linux? 
<div style="text-align: justify"> Linux (pronounced "LIH-nucks") is a 32-bit operating system (OS) that can be used on virtually every computer hardware platform. Originally designed for the Intel x86 platform, it is now available for Intel, Mac, Sparc, Alpha, embedded devices, and many more platforms. Linux is a UNIX-like OS that is very stable, reliable, and flexi-ble. It is used on PCs, professional workstations, servers, routers, and practically every other computing platform. Linux works well in all these environments, and because it is multi-user and multi-tasking, it can perform virtually any job or group of jobs quickly and efficiently. Linux is as powerful as any other operating system, and most importantly, it is free. Linux was created to be a free alternative to UNIX and has become a competitor for all operating systems available today. This fact has enabled Linux to greatly increase its user base, and to be supported and used by the largest corporations and governments in the world. Because of its open nature and technical strengths, Enterprise use of Linux is best illustrated by its large-scale use on the Internet â€”it powers a majority of Internet applications, including the Apache Web server. Linux has sprung from humble beginnings to become a widely used and respected OS on essentially all computing platforms. Linux is a direct competitor with other high profile operating systems, such as UNIX and Microsoft Windows. </div>
