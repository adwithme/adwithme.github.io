Internet usage has become commonplace these days. We are advancing our diary in the digital world with the latest Wi-Fi technology.

Has Wi-Fi changed our lives, but is it also having a negative impact? Today we are going to discuss this topic briefly.

We've all heard that Wi-Fi is bad for your health. There is an argument that Wi-Fi emits a lot of radiation which is harmful to health.

Does it really matter or not? If yes, what kind of problems are there?

In fact, the issue of where Wi-Fi causes health problems starts with its band. The first is 2.4 GHz, the next is 5 GHz. Now where there is a mistake, it is not in 2.4 or 5. The fault here is in GHz.

The word gigahertz worries people more than anything else. Some people may come to your house and say that there is so much gigahertz radiation in such a small room, that we are even more worried that it is wrong.

In this case, the thing we need to understand is radiation. It is important to understand the effects of radiation. We are living in fear that it will affect whatever someone says. When it comes to the energy of radiation, let's first talk about the radiation of the sun coming to our earth.

The radiation of the sun coming to the surface of the earth is more than terahertz, not gigahertz. Are we now worried about the radiation of the sun on the earth's surface? That is many times the frequency.

We are affected by radiation with frequencies of ultraviolet or higher. If the radiation from the sun's rays around us is nothing more than a terahertz of radiation, then it is unnatural to say that the normal radiation from Wi-Fi affects us.

In some cases, an operator is releasing high frequency radiation. That is affecting health. In the case of Nepal, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority is regularly regulating the frequency.

"We are measuring the radiation given by different operators according to our schedule. Its radiation ranges from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz. Radiation does not affect our health in any way. It has also been certified by the International Telecommunication Union and the World Health Organization. So we don't have to worry about Wi-Fi radiation, ‚Äùsaid NEA director Min Prasad Aryal.

In fact, microwave ovens have less radiation than Wi-Fi. When cooking in such an oven, it may be understood that the food cooked by its radiation may be harmful.

One thing to be clear is that less radiation does not have to be more effective. The radiation we hear from X-rays, gamma rays, alpha rays, etc., is damaging our skin cells. For that, there is no need to be afraid immediately. But due to the pollution we are doing, the weight layer is getting thinner day by day.

It cannot be said that ultraviolet radiation will not come directly from the sun tomorrow. In this we are talking about the radiation of Wi-Fi. Normal MHz, KHz, GHz. Terahertz radiation does not affect our health.

Since the radiation of Wi-Fi is up to 2.4 or 5 GHz, we can use Wi-Fi with confidence. Similarly, the question that comes up about the Wi-Fi antenna is also of very small power. Its power is less than 0.1 watts.

What good is a Wi-Fi antenna with less than 0.1 watts when a bulb of more than 100 watts we are using has no effect?

So we don't have to worry about Wi-Fi. Even with Wi-Fi on overnight, it consumes very little electricity. If you want to reduce the power consumption even a little, you can turn off the Wi-Fi before going to bed at night.

Similarly, turning on Wi-Fi overnight may interfere with the automatic cloud-based backup of your phone, tablet or PC.

But, if you have Disabled Auto Backup Cloud, don't be afraid of that either. You can confidently turn on Wi-Fi on day and night.
